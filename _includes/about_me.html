        I have over 2 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked
        at both small startups and large organizations. While I am a proficient Android and Java Enterprise
        developer, my passion is in building scalable Rails Web Apps.
        </p>
        <p>
        I love building things.
        While hard engineering problems are often fun to tackle,
        I am most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
        I am looking for a mid-level software developer role where I can take on team leadership
        responsibilities, and gain experience with architecture and project management.
